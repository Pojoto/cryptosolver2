To the two friends the treehouse was much more than a treehouse It was a sanctuary away from the other kids where they could be themselves without being teased or bullied It was their secret fortress hidden high in the branches of a huge oak that only they knew existed At least that is what they thought They were more than a little annoyed when their two younger sisters decided to turn the treehouse into a princess castle by painting the inside pink and putting glitter everywhere

The irony of the situation hadnt escaped her She had taken years to sculpt the perfect persona with the perfect look that she shared on Instagram She knew her hundreds of thousands of followers envied that life she showed and stayed engaged with her because they wanted that life too The truth was that she wanted the perfect life she portrayed more than any of her fans The fact was that despite all the perfection she shared on social media her life was actually more of a mess than most
